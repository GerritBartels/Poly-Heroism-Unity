# Poly Heroism: A Tiny Knight's Odyssey

The creation of this game was part of the "Introduction to Unity" Course 2023 at the University of OsnabrÃ¼ck.

In our game, you will play a tiny knight that has to fight its way through waves of evil monsters on all sorts of different procedurally generated tiny planets! You will need to stay alive for as long as possible, while cleverly assigning skill points at the end of every level to make your knight all the more powerful. Good luck surviving for as long as possible ðŸ˜‰.
